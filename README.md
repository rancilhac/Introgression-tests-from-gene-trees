# Introgression tests from gene trees

# Introduction
#
This script performs introgression tests in 4-taxa oriented trees, in a similar fashion as ABBA/BABA tests, but using gene trees as input data instead of SNPs. Thus, it is usefull to investigate introgression signals in large phylogenomic datasets.
